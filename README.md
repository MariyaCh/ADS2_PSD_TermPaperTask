You are required to design a method in a class which generates random
numbers. The method accepts the following variables as input (int amount, int minRange, int maxRange). 
The amount variable depicts how many random numbers will be returned, the minRange variable depicts the starting range of the random number and
the maxRange variable depicts the maximum number that the random number could be.
Write out a code example, in either Java, Python or C# which has two preconditions and two-posts conditions for the random number generator method.
You are required to design the full method, with the associated pre- and postconditions.
